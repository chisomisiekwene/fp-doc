Welcome to Fountainpay Developers Documentation

## Quick Start

Welcome! You can send and receive payments using a variety of payment channels using our APIs. What you need to do is as follows:

- Create a Fountainpay account if you do not have one.
- There is a default test service account created on your profile.
- Click on services on the dashboard then click on the default test service and activate it.
- [After switching to the test mode, you can get the API keys](https://staging.fountainpay.ng/services/dashboard).
- [Visit the overview of Collecting Payments if you wish to get payments from clients](collecting-payment#overview).
- [Create your integration by utilizing one of our plugins or frameworks](sdk-plugins).
- Deactivate the test mode when you're ready, then send it.
