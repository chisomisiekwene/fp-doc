# Direct Charge

## Overview

Fountainpay HTML Inline, Standard, and HTML checkout make it easy for you to collect payments via card, bank, or any of our supported methods with one integration. 
There are situations when you desire greater discretion or a unique fix that works with your app. Direct charge enters the picture here. 
We supply the APIs for clients to be charged, but you are responsible for gathering their payment information and bringing your own UI and payment flow. 
This entails that you can control and modify the consumer experience however you like.

Note: With direct charge, you'll need to integrate separately for each payment method you want to accept, which can be difficult. 
Only use direct charge when a specific payment method will be used by your customer (like cards or banks).
