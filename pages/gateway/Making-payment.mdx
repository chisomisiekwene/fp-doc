# Making Payment

## Payment link

Send links to your clients to make payments.<br/> The type of split you want to implement with this subaccount is split type.

If you want a part of each transaction, use "percentage." <br/>
If you want to get a flat charge from each transaction with the remainder going to the subaccount, use the term "flat."

**Split Value:** The amount you desire to receive each transaction in commission. To collect 6% from each transaction, 
for instance, split type would be "percentage" and split value would be 0.06; similarly, 
to receive 500 naira from each transaction, split type would be "flat" and split value would be 500.


## Subaccount/Split payment
### Overview
You can divide an incoming payment across one or more bank accounts and a commission fee using Fountainpay's subaccount tool. 
This can be helpful in a variety of ways, such as:
    * You take on the role of an aggregator, managing payments for various businesses in return for a commission.
    * You manage payments and take a fee from each transaction on a marketplace where various merchants offer services.

You should first create a single or more subaccounts in order to use split payments (the bank accounts you want to split to). You can then choose how you want to divide the money when you get payment.
Any money you provide them will be transferred to their account in accordance with your settlement cycle.
